Description: Provides vectorised functions for computing p-values of various
    common discrete statistical tests, as described e.g. in Agresti (2002)
    <doi:10.1002/0471249688>, including their distributions. Exact and
    approximate computation methods are provided. For exact p-values, several
    procedures of determining two-sided p-values are included, which are
    outlined in more detail in Hirji (2006) <doi:10.1201/9781420036190>.
